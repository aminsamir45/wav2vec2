# Efficient wav2vec 2.0 for Ultra-Low Resource Speech Recognition

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Develop architectural improvements to wav2vec 2.0 that enhance performance in ultra-low resource scenarios (10 minutes to 1 hour of labeled speech data) while maintaining computational efficiency.

## ðŸ“Š Current wav2vec 2.0 Model

### What it does:
- **Self-supervised pre-training**: Learns speech representations from unlabeled audio via masked prediction
- **Contrastive learning**: Distinguishes true speech segments from distractors using quantized targets
- **Fine-tuning**: Adapts to ASR tasks with minimal labeled data (achieves 4.8/8.2 WER with 10min labeled data)

### Architecture:
- **Feature Encoder**: Multi-layer CNN extracts latent representations from raw audio
- **Contextualized Network**: Transformer builds sequence-aware representations
- **Quantization Module**: Creates discrete speech units for contrastive learning

## ðŸ”¬ Experimental Improvements

### 1. **Smart Masking Strategies**
- **Current**: Random span masking
- **Experiment**: Phoneme-aware, adaptive, and linguistic-informed masking patterns

### 2. **Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning**
- **Current**: Full model fine-tuning
- **Experiment**: LoRA adapters, progressive unfreezing, selective layer training

### 3. **Enhanced Data Utilization**
- **Current**: Standard augmentation
- **Experiment**: Cross-lingual transfer, synthetic data generation, self-training loops

### 4. **Lightweight Architecture Variants**
- **Current**: Fixed Transformer architecture
- **Experiment**: Efficient attention mechanisms, dynamic depth, hierarchical processing

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Plan

1. **Baseline Setup**: Reproduce original results on LibriSpeech 10min/1hr subsets
2. **Ablation Studies**: Test each improvement independently
3. **Combination Analysis**: Evaluate best performing combinations
4. **Benchmarking**: Compare against state-of-the-art low-resource methods
5. **Demo Creation**: Interactive comparison tool

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics
- **Primary**: WER improvement on LibriSpeech 10min/1hr subsets
- **Secondary**: Training efficiency, inference speed, model size reduction
- **Tertiary**: Cross-lingual generalization performance

## ðŸ’» Computational Requirements
- **Hardware**: Single GPU (Google Colab Pro sufficient)
- **Time**: 2-4 weeks part-time
- **Cost**: <$50 total compute costs
